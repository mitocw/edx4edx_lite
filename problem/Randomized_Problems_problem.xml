    <h2>Randomization and Numerical Response Problems</h2>
    <p>
Custom response and numerical response problems may also be written to
provide randomization of problems.  Randomization can be used to
change the question asked, so that each student gets a different
question.  This helps discourage automated cheating, for example.</p>
    <p>Note that <i>how often</i> a problem is re-randomized is determined
by settings defined within <tt>course.xml</tt>.  For example, problems
can be re-randomized (ie the seed for the random number generator
changed) every time the problem is viewed, or only once per student.</p>
    <p>Here is a simple example of a randomized problem, written using numerical response.</p>
    <script type="loncapa/python">
rx = random.randrange(1,20,1)
ry = 10-rx
</script>
    <p>Let \(x = $rx\).  Give y such that \(x+y=10\):</p>
    <numericalresponse answer="$ry">
      <responseparam type="tolerance" default="5%" name="tol" description="Numerical Tolerance"/>
      <text>
y = <textline/>

    </numericalresponse>

</problem>
