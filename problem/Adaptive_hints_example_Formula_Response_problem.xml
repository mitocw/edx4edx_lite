    <p>Hints can be provided to students, based on the last response given, as well as the history of responses given.  Here is an example of a hint produced by a Formula Response problem.</p>
    <p>
What is the equation of the line which passess through ($x1,$y1) and
($x2,$y2)?</p>
    <p>The correct answer is <tt>$answer</tt>. A common error is to invert the equation for the slope.  Enter <tt>
$wrongans</tt> to see a hint.</p>

        <text>You have inverted the slope in the question.  The slope is
          (y2-y1)/(x2 - x1) you have the slope as (x2-x1)/(y2-y1).</text>
