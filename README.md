edx4edx
=======

This is a set of source content and code for an edX course about the edX system.  

Included are demo problems for option, multiple choice, string,
numerical, formula, symbolic math, image, custom (python script
graded) response, and schematic response problems.

A description of latex2edx is also provided, with examples (though
some of that needs to be updated).

No support is available for this repository and the only available documentation 
is that which is in the source code. Contributions are welcome.
