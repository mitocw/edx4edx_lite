  <body><h1> Importing edX courses using LaTeX</h1><p><a href="/static/latex2edx.tgz">latex2edx</a> is a preliminary tool which may be used to
construct an edX course from a [mathjaxinline]\LaTeX[/mathjaxinline] file.</p><h2>Requirements</h2><ol><li>Download and install <a href="/static/latex2edx.tgz">latex2edx package</a></li><li>Install <a href="http://plastex.sourceforge.net/">PlasTeX</a>
(on some systems: pip install plastex)</li><li>Install <a href="http://lxml.de/">python lxml library</a> (on
some systems: pip install lxml)</li><li>Install <a href="http://xmlsoft.org/xmllint.html">xmllint</a>  (on Ubuntu, <tt>apt-get install libxml2-utils</tt>)
</li></ol><h2>Hints and Guidelines</h2><ol><li>latex2edx can be used to create entire courses from one latex
 file, to update problems in (or add problems to) an existing course,
 or to simply generate individual problem XML files from a latex file.
  </li><li> Do not put spaces around the "=" sign in the abox statements; the abox parameters are space delimited.
</li><li>
Each problem should be given a unique name; don't reuse "Problem 1"
in different files, for example.  This is because each problem's
filename is generated from the name.
</li><li>
Under osX, generate the tex files using <a href="http://aquamacs.org/">emacs</a> or <a href="http://macvim.org/OSX/index.php ">vi</a> instead of textedit.
Latex cannot take special characters in unicode format, which are
being generated by textedit.
</li><li>
Latex errors (mismatched tags, typos, etc) can be caught by running
latex or pdflatex on the file.  Use the edXpsl.sty style file, and
latex should produce a fine user-readable output file.
</li><li>
The edX problem css stylesheets currently do not allow inline
display of answer input boxes.  This is being fixed.
</li></ol><h2>Example</h2><p>Here is a simple example of a latex file from which a rudimentary course can be generated:</p><pre>
\documentclass[12pt]{article}

\usepackage{edXpsl}	% edX

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{document}

\begin{edXcourse}{1.00x}{1.00x Fall 2012}

\begin{edXchapter}{Unit 1}

\begin{edXsection}{Introduction}

\begin{edXsequential}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{edXproblem}{Problem 1}{40}

This is a sample problem.  What is the number made famous by
Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy?

\edXabox{type='symbolic' size='90' expect='42' }

\end{edXproblem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\end{edXsequential}

\end{edXsection}

Note: Images (via includegraphics) can be made to work; YMMV.
